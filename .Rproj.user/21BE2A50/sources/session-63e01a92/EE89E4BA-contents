## Project Overview

::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}
BytesLog is a cross-platform mobile application I developed during my bachelor's project. The app empowers users to log their daily food intake, set personalized dietary goals, and monitor their progress. To enhance user engagement, the app features gamified achievements and badges, along with visually rich insights into calorie and macronutrient intake. (code is in a private github repo)

### Technologies Used
 - Frontend: `React Native` (cross-platform mobile app development)
 - Backend: `Django Framework`
 - Database & API: `External food API` (Edamam) and `Firebase` for real-time data storage
 - Testing: `Jest` for unit testing and automated testing using `GitHub Actions workflows`
 - UI Framework: `Bootstrap`

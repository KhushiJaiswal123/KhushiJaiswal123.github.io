# Survey Insights: Visualizing Student Feedback with Power BI

These Power BI dashboards were developed during my role as Student Association Tech & Operations Officer at London Business School. While the dashboards are relatively simple, they effectively summarize insights from student survey responses to measure satisfaction and gather feedback on well-being and events. They served as a foundation for data-driven decision-making, helping to enhance the student experience and refine event strategies. This project highlights my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data, even in straightforward formats, to deliver actionable insights.

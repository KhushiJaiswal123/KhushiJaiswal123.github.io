# Description
The Outfit Of The Day (OOTD) Recommendation System generates personalized outfit suggestions based on real-time weather data for London. The system uses weather parameters like temperature, precipitation, and wind speed to select appropriate tops, bottoms, shoes, outerwear, and accessories (e.g., sunglasses or raincoats), ensuring the outfit matches the current weather conditions. The final output is rendered as an image of all recommended items for that day and emailed to the user.

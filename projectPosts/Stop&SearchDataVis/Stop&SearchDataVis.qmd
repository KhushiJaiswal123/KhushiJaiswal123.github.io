# Project Overview

Analyzed Metropolitan Police's stop-and-search data from September 2022 to uncover patterns in searches and outcomes. The project used data wrangling and visualization to explore trends by age group, time of day, and search results.

## Key Insights

- Age Group Analysis: Individuals aged 18â€“24 were stopped and searched the most.
- Outcome Trends: Across all age groups, individuals are usually not investigated further after they have been stopped - however the 18-24 age range is most likely to have further actions taken e.g. arrest, penalty notice. 
- Temporal Patterns: Searches peaked during late evenings and at the end of the work week, highlighting a time-based pattern in enforcement activity.
